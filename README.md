# thresholdscanplots
This repository has 2 python programs (drawefficiencies.py and drawefficienciesirr.py) that read from csv files (combined.csv and combinedirr.csv) to create 2 plots (ThScanPlot.png and ThScanPlotIrr.png).<br><br>
Both python programs creates a plot of the absolute efficiency (chance for a hit/stub given a particle passing throught the detector) as a function of strip/pixel for the threshold scan done on the PS Module and FNAL Testbeam.<br><br>
Stubs don't have an x-axis and will have the same x-position as the pixel/strip data from their respective run.<br><br>
The reason there are 2 programs, csv files, and plots is because one corresponds with the threshold scan on the irradiated portion of the module, while the other corresponds to the threshold scan done on the non-irradiated portion of the module. The files the correspond to the irradiated threshold scan have an "irr" before their file extension, while the files that correspond to the non-irradiated threshold scan don't have this "irr".<br><br>
The csv files have 5 columns, which store information for pixel threshold (DAC units) in column 1, strip threshold (DAC units) in column 2, pixel efficiency (%) in column 3, strip efficiency (%) in column 4, and stub efficiency (%) in column 5. These measurements were copied from the FNAL testbeam JUne 2023 logbook, and the programs automatically convert the efficiencies from a % to a decimal value.<br><br>
The efficiency measurements shown in the plots and csv files were obtain using "coarse" calculations from Chewie.<br><br>
